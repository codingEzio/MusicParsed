[Pre-Chorus x2]
G A Bm D
I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
              Bm
I don't wanna be alive
G                  D
I don't wanna be alive
                       A
I just wanna die today
                 Bm
I just wanna die
                       G
I don't wanna be alive
                   D
I don't wanna be alive
                 A
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1]
DDD UDU DD
Bm
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
          G
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
       D
And my life don't even matter
                               A
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
              Bm
I never had a place to call my own
              G
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
          D
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
               A
They say every life is precious but nobody care about mine
[Pre-Chorus]
DUD DUD DUDU
Bm
I been on the low
                 G
I been taking my time
                          D
I feel like I'm out of my mind
                           A
It feel like my life ain't mine
[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
              Bm
I want you to be alive
G                  D
I want you to be alive
                          A
You don't gotta die today
                    Bm
You don't gotta die
                       G
I want you to be alive
                   D
I want you to be alive
                    A
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why
[Verse 2]
DUD DUD DUDU
A
It's the very first breath
                      D
When your head's been drowning underwater
    A
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
D
Chest to chest with a lover
     D
It's holding on, though the road's long
           A
And seeing light in the darkest things
             D
And when you stare at your reflection
                A
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
[Verse 3]
DUD DUD DUDU
Bm                                                    G
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
                              D
I know you're the reason I believe in life
                                       A
What's the day without a little night?
                                   Bm
I'm just tryna shed a little light
               G
It can be hard
                  D
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
    A
You got everything to give right now
[Pre-Chorus]
Single strums

I been on the low
                 G

                          D
I feel like I'm out of my mind
                           A

                  Bm
I don't wanna die
                       G
Finally wanna be alive
                     D
I finally wanna be alive
                  A
I don't wanna die

[Outro]
G A Bm D
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
                  Bm
But I don't wanna cry
              G
I don't wanna cry anymore
               D
I wanna feel alive
                   A
I don't even wanna die anymore
                 Bm
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
              G
I don't wanna
                          D     A
I don't even wanna die anymore
G A Bm D
