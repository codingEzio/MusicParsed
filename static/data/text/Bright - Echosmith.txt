[Verse 1]
F           [F Fsus4]   F     [F Fsus4]
I think the universe is on my side
F               [F Fsus4] F    [F Fsus4]
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
B♭           C                             F [F Fsus4]
Days are good and that's the way it should be
F [F Fsus4]

F             [F      Fsus4]  F      [F Fsus4]
You sprinkled star dust on my pillow case
F           [F       Fsus4]   F       [F Fsus4]
It's like a moonbeam brushed across my face
B♭             C                             F [F Fsus4]
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

    You make me sing
Dm              B♭
oo-oo-oo, la la laaa

I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
F                       Dm          C
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
F                      Dm       C
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
        B♭                   F              C
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
       C/              F    [F C] B♭
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
F    [F C] B♭
Bright, so bright

[Verse 2]
F         [F   Fsus4] F        [F Fsus4]
And I see colors in a different way
F            [F       Fsus4] F      [F Fsus4]
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
B♭          C                             F [F Fsus4]
Life is good and that's the way it should be
