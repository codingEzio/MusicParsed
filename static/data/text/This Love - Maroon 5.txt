[Verse 1]

G                      Cm
I was so high I didn't recognize
          Fm                                  G
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind....
G                            Cm
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
          Fm                           G
Never to return again but always in my heart

[Chorus]

Cm   Fm      Bb7         Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         Bb7            Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        Bb7           Eb
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    Bb7                Eb      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]

G                           Cm
I tried my best to feed her appetite
                Fm                                  
Keep her coming every night
                    G                            
So hard to keep her satisfied
                              Cm 
Kept playing love like it was just a game
              Fm
Pretending to feel the same
                     G
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]

Cm   Fm      Bb7         Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         Bb7            Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        Bb7           Eb
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    Bb7                Eb      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]

 Fm
I'll fix these broken things
  Eb
Repair your broken wings
G7                          Cm  
And make sure everything's alright
Fm
My pressure on your hips
Eb
Sinking my fingertips
G
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]

Cm   Fm      Bb7         Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
Cm       Fm         Bb7            Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
Cm  Fm        Bb7           Eb
Her heart is breaking in front of me
Cm         Fm    Bb7                Eb      G    Cm    Fm     G
I have no choice, I won't say goodbye anymore
