[Verse 1]
          B             F♯             G♯m             D♯m
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
       E              B              E
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the
F♯
same
       B                 F♯               G♯m
Now my heart feel like December, when somebody say your
D♯m
name
         E                  B               E
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one
 F♯
 day, ayy
[Pre-Chorus 1]
B      F♯                    G♯m             D♯m
  Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday,
ayy-ayy
E          B                      E                    F♯
  But everything gon' be alright, go and raise a glass and

[Chorus 1]
B                  F♯
Here's to the ones that we got
G♯m                D♯m
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
           E                 B

'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        E              F♯                        B

There's a time that I remember, when I never felt so lost
       E               B               E            F♯
When I felt all of the hatred, was too powerful to stop
(ooh yeah)
       B                  F♯              G♯m
Now my heart feel like an ember, and it's lighting up the
D♯m
dark
        E                B               E            F♯

[Pre-Chorus 2]
B      F♯                    G♯m             D♯m
