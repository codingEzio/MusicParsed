CAPO 1
[Verse 1]
C
Heaven help me
        Bb                F
My mind changes like the wind
C
Please excuse me
        Bb             F
I don't know where to begin
    F
But I

Didn't think I cared
C
I could be your friend
Bb
But I'm unprepared
    C                    F
Oh, I've never felt like this
F
I was unaware
C
You were lighting flares
Bb
Now I'm running scared
    C                  Gm
Oh, how did it come to this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm            Bb
You know I've never
        F            C
Been so lonely on my own
       Gm
And it shows
               Bb
'Cause I don't see you
       F
Like I used to
    C
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

[Chorus]
F
Oh
       C
All my nights
           Bb
Taste like gold
               C
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
           C
And all my days
           Bb
We can lay low
                 C
Yeah, when we're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow

[Verse 2]
F
I can rearrange
C
Would you do the same?
Bb
I don't wanna change
C                           F
But you're just too good to miss
F
'Cause I'm intertwined
C
And I'm running blind
Bb
But I don't mind
C                      Gm
I'm so glad it came to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm            Bb
You know I've never
        F            C
Been so lonely on my own
       Gm
And it shows
               Bb
'Cause I don't see ya
       F
Like I used to
    C
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

[Chorus]
F
Oh
       C
All my nights
           Bb
Taste like gold
               C
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
           C
And all my days
            Bb
We can lay low
                 C
Yeah, when we're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow

[Post-Chorus]
F                         C
It's a little bit clearer now
                             Bb
I love you like the sun came out

Oh
      C
We're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow
                        C
It's like I never had a doubt
                             Bb
I love you like the sun came out

Oh
      C
We're waking up

We're waking up


[Bridge]
F
Like I told ya
C
Don't look backwards
Gm
'Cause now I see you here
Bb
Nothing else matters
F
Like I told ya
C
Don't look backwards
Gm
'Cause now I see you here

I'm going back on the things that I know

[Chorus]
F
Oh
       C
All my nights
           Bb
Taste like gold
               C
Yeah, when I'm with you
                     F
It's like everything glows
           C               Bb
And all my days we can lay low
                 C
Yeah, when we're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow

[Post-Chorus]
                          C
It's a little bit clearer now
                             Bb
I love you like the sun came out

Oh
      C
We're waking up
                F
We're waking up slow
                        C
It's like I never had a doubt
                             Bb
I love you like the sun came out

Oh
      C
We're waking up

We're waking up
