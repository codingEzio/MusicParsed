Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!

[ANGELICA/COMPANY]

               Cm7
A toast to the groom (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
       Eb/Bb
To the bride (To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
          Fm11
From your sister (Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
        Abmaj7                       G7
Who is always by your side (By your side)
        Cm7
To your union (To the union! To the revolution!)
        Eb/Bb
And the hope that you provide (provide, provide)
        Fm11
May you always (always)
    Abmaj7      G7
Be satisfied (rewind)


[REWIND INTERLUDE]


[ANGELICA]

Cm7
I remember that night I just might
regret that night for the rest of my days
Eb/Bb
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves
to win our praise
Fm11
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can't quite place
Abmaj7              G7                                     Cm7
 But Alexander I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
  Eb/Bb
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
    Fm11
And when you said "hi" I forgot my dang name
       Abmaj7                    G7
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame
This is not a game


[HAMILTON]
Cm7
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Eb/Bb
I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
Fm11
You're like me. I'm never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Abmaj7
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
G7
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Cm7
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Eb/Bb
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where's your family from?

[HAMILTON]
Fm11
Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
    Abmaj7              G7
but just you wait, just you wait


[ANGELICA]
          Cm7
So so so, so this is what it feels like to match wits
with someone at your level. What the hell is the catch?
         Eb/Bb
It's the feeling of freedom, of seeing the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right?
Fm11
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement
Abmaj7
It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
G7
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
       Cm7
He's a bit of a flirt but I'mma give it a chance
I asked about his family, did you see his answer?
    Eb/Bb
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless; he's flying by the seat of his pants
Fm11
Handsome, boy does he know it
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it
Abmaj7
I wanna take him far away from this place
       G7
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...


[ELIZA]
Cm7
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is

[ELIZA]
Eb
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just

[ELIZA]
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
                    Fm
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I'm about to change your life.

[HAMIlTON]
Then by all means, lead the way.

[COMPANY]
       Cm
Number one!

[ANGELICA]

I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
Eb
My father has no sons so I'm the one
who has to social climb for one
            Eb/Bb
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
Fm/Ab
And Alexander is penniless, Ha!
G7
That doesn't mean I want him any less


[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you.

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister.

[COMPANY]
       Cm
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status
    Eb
I'd have to be naive to set that aside
Maybe that is why
I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Abmaj7
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
G7
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service.

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.

[ANGELICA]
I'll leave you to it.

[COMPANY]
       Cm
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
         Eb
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
     Fm9
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
        Abmaj7
He'd be mine
                   G7
She would say "I'm fine"
She'd be lying

Cm
But when I fantasize at night it's Alexander's eyes
Eb
as I romanticize what might have been if I hadn't
Fm
sized him up so quickly
   Cm
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
                               Ab
At least I keep his eyes in my life
