Fm         Eb6   Db 
I want you by my side
Ab                    C 
So that I never feel alone again
Fm             Eb6     Db 
They've always been so kind
Ab                           C 
But now they've brought you away from here

I hope they didn't get your mind

Your heart is too strong anyway

We need to fetch back the time

You've never danced like this before

But we don't talk about it

Dancin on doin the boogie all night long

Stoned in paradise

Coldest winter for me
Ab                 C   
No sun is shining anymore
Fm        Eb6            Db  
The only thing I feel is pain
Ab                   C   
Caused by absence of you
Fm          Eb6            Db  
Suspense is controlling my mind 
Ab                    C  
I cannot find the way out of here

I want you by my side

So that I never feel alone
