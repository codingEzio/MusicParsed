[Verse]

Fm         Eb7   Db 
I want you by my side
Ab                    C 
So that I never feel alone again
Fm             Eb7     Db 
They've always been so kind
Ab                           C 
But now they've brought you away from here
Fm          Eb7             Db 
I hope they didn't get your mind
Ab                        C   
Your heart is too strong anyway
Fm         Eb7            Db 
We need to fetch back the time
Ab                    C 
They have stolen from us


[Chorus]
Db 
And I want you
       Ab
We can bring it on the floor
             C                  Fm
You've never danced like this before
             Eb7
But we don't talk about it
Db                 Ab
Dancin on doin the boogie all night long
C             Fm
Stoned in paradise
          Eb7
Shouldn't talk about it

Fm      Eb7        Db 
Coldest winter for me
Ab                 C   
No sun is shining anymore
Fm        Eb7            Db  
The only thing I feel is pain
Ab                   C   
Caused by absence of you
Fm          Eb7            Db  
Suspense is controlling my mind 
Ab                    C  
I cannot find the way out of here
Fm         Eb7   Db 
I want you by my side
Ab                    C 
So that I never feel alone


[Chorus]
