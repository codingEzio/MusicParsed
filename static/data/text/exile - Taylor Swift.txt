[Verse 1]
G
I can see you standing, honey
Em
With his arms around your body
G                                     Em
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
G
And it took you five whole minutes
Em
To pack us up and leave me with it
G                                      Em
 Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus]
C            D                Em
I think I've seen this film before
      D
And I didn't like the ending
C             D           Em
You're not my homeland anymore
   D                   C
So what am I defending now?
            D                Em                G
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
C             D                Em   Em
 I think I've seen this film before
G    Em   G  Em
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
G
I can see you starin', honey
Em
Like he's just your understudy
G                                       Em
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
G
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Em
Balancin' on breaking branches
G                             Em
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus]
C            D                Em
I think I've seen this film before
      D
And I didn't like the ending
C            D          Em
I'm not your problem anymore
   D                   C
So who am I offending now?
            D                 Em                G
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
C             D                Em
 I think I've seen this film before
       Em
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge]
G              Em               D
 So step right out, there is no amount
          C
Of crying I can do for you
         G
All this time
                             Em
We always walked a very thin line
                        D
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
                         C
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
         G
All this time
                             Em
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
                        D
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
                                C
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
G            Em          D
 So many signs, so many signs
                        C
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus]
C            D                Em
I think I've seen this film before
      D
And I didn't like the ending
C             D           Em
You're not my homeland anymore
   D                   C
So what am I defending now?
            D                Em                G
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
C            D                Em
I think I've seen this film before
       Em
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Outro]

'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
                         G
You never gave a warning sign
Em  D  C
Ah, ah
