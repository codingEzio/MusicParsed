CAPO 1
[Verse 1]
F
 What a way to wake up
G                 Am  G   F
 Feeling like I'm overexposed
I guess it's kind of messed up
G                  Am    G     F
 That I just wanna keep myself closed
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                               G        Am
 Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
F                                G         Am
 Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough
 
 
[Chorus-1]
               F
I wish I never met you
G                     Am
But it's a little too late
               F
I wish I never met you
G                     Am
But it's a little too late
    F                                G                  Am
You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
               F           G Am
I wish I never met you, oh
                      F    G Am
But it's a little too late

[Chorus-2]

                        F    G Am
Yeah, it's a little too late
It's a little too late
 
[Verse 2]
F
 When I was a young one
G            Am       G   F
 Never saw a cloud in the sky
 But now I'm coming undone
G             Am         G    F
 Staring at myself, wondering why
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                               G        Am
 Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
F                                G         Am
 Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough
 
 
[Chorus-1]

[Chorus-2]
                        F
Yeah, it's a little too late
G              Am
 It's a little
Yeah, it's a little too late

I cry like a river
Fist fight with the mirror
I guess life ain't all glitter
I wish I never met you

         F
It takes time to get bigger
      G              Am
Shine bright, find a rhythm
    G    F                G Am
And I'll try not be bitter
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                    F
I just wish I never met you
G                     Am
But it's a little too late
                     F
Yeah, I wish I never met you
G                       Am
Yeah, it's a little too late
 
 
[Chorus-1]
 
[Outro]
    F                                G                  Am
You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
               F           G Am
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late
