CAPO 3

[Verse]
Em                      D                G Am7
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em                      D                G Am7
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em               D           G Am7
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em                        D             G Am7
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even
 
Em                    D           G    Am7
Her best days will be some of my worst 
    Em            D                G       Am7
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
      Em                   D          G    Am7
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
    Em                        D             G     Am7
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no
 
[Chorus]
C         G                       D                   Em
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you, and
C         G                        D                  Em
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK, yeah
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces 
 
[Instrumental]
Em D G Am7
 
[Verse]
     Em                    D         G  Am7
They say bad things happen for a reason 
    Em                  D             G   Am7
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
    Em                   D              G Am7
Cos she's moved on while I'm still grieving 
    Em                        D             G     Am7
And when a heart breaks no it don't break even (even, no)
 
[Chorus]
C         G                       D                   Em
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you, and
C         G                        D                  Em
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK, yeah
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces, yeah
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces  (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces  (Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

Em D G Am7

[Bridge]
        Em                         D
You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
G                       Am7
You took your suitcase, I took the blame. 
        Em                       D            G
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
        Am7
Cos you left me with no love, no love to my name. 
 
[Verse]
Em                      D                G Am7
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em                      D                G Am7
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em               D           G Am7
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em                        D
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break
G
No, it don't break
       Am7               C
No, it don't break even, no! 
 
[Chorus]
          G                 D                   Em
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you, and
C         G                        D                  Em
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces, yeah  (Oh, I'm falling, I'm falling... yeah)
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
C    G          D  Em
 I'm falling to pieces  (Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)
