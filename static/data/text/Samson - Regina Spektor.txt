CAPO 1
[Verse]
Bb       Cm   Dm       Eb
  You are my sweetest downfall
Eb F          Gm      F         Eb
I  loved you first, I loved you first
  Eb        Bb        Cm    Dm      Eb   Eb
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
Eb F       Gm    F       Eb
I  have to go, I have to go
                Eb                   Eb
  Your hair was long,  when we first met

[Chorus]
F           Gm
Samson went back to bed
Bb                 Eb
Not much hair left on his head
   F              Gm
He ate a slice of wonder bread
    Bb                 F
and went right back to bed
     F               Gm
And history books forgot about us
        Bb           Eb
and the bible didn't mention us
        Bb    F      Gm
And the bible didn't mention us,
         Eb
not even once

[Verse]
Bb       Cm   Dm       Eb
  You are my sweetest downfall
Eb F          Gm      F         Eb
I  loved you first, I loved you first
Eb          Bb         Cm      Dm     Eb
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
Eb           F       Gm      F               Eb
But they're just old light, they're just old light
              Eb                 Eb
Your hair was long when we first met

[Chorus]
F           Gm
Samson came to my bed
Bb              Eb
Told me that my hair was red
F             Gm            Bb           F
Told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
     F     Gm       Bb                    Bb
Oh I cut his hair myself one night
  Bb                            Eb
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
       Eb               Bb
And he told me that I'd done alright
    Bb         F       Gm
and kissed me 'til the mornin' light, the mornin' light
       Bb         F       Gm            Eb
and he kissed me 'til the mornin' light

[Outro]
F           Gm
Samson went back to bed
Bb                 Eb
Not much hair left on his head
   F              Gm
He ate a slice of wonder bread
    Bb                 F
and went right back to bed
       F        Gm        Bb
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
        Bb                 Eb
Yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
    Eb               Bb
And history books forgot about us
        Bb    F      Gm
And the bible didn't mention us,
         Eb
not even once

[Chorus]
Bb       Cm   Dm       Eb
  You are my sweetest downfall
Eb F          Gm
I  loved you first
