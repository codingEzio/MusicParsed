[Verse]
G         D             
 Lately I feel so small
   C               D               G
Or maybe it's just that my bed has grown
                D         
I never noticed it before
    C                 D            Am
but you were there so how was I to know

[Pre-Chorus]
          C
That this single bed
    G                D   
Was always meant for two
Am        C
 Not just anyone
G                 D      
 It was meant for me and you

[Chorus]
G               D                 C
 And now you're halfway round the world
        D            G
And I'm just a day behind
       D                 C
Nothin seems to fill the hole
            D                 G
That I have since you left my side
              D            C
You'll always be my little girl
         D                G
Though I can't hold you tonight
               D                 C
And now you're halfway round the world
        D            G    D C D
And I'm just a day behind
G D C D

[Verse]
G          D
 I wake up in the night and
  C               D
I turn around and find that you're not there
G              D                   C
I just like to watch you sleep and lay by you
  D
I love to feel you near
G            D
 I think I'm going crazy
C             D                G
Every day, confusion starts to grow
                D         
I never noticed it before
    C                 D            Am
but you were there so how was I to know

[Pre-Chorus]
          C
That this single bed
    G                D   
Was always meant for two
Am        C
 Not just anyone
G                 D      
 It was meant for me and you
