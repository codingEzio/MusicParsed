[Verse 1]
F              C
You got a fast car.
Am                 G
I want a ticket to anywhere.
F               C
Maybe we make a deal,
Am                    G
Maybe together we can get somewhere.
F            C
Any place is better.
Am                      G
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
F                C
Maybe we'll make something,
Am               G
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.

[Verse 2]
F              C
You got a fast car.
Am              G
I got a plan to get us out of here
F                     C
I been working at the convenience store,
Am                     G
Managed to save just a little bit of money.
F                       C
Won't have to drive too far
Am                         G
Just 'cross the border and into the city,
F             C
You and I can both get jobs
    Am                  G
And finally see what it means to be living.

[Verse 3]
         F                  C
You see, my old man's got a problem
   Am                               G
He live with the bottle, thatâ€™s the way it is.
   F                           C
He says his body's too old for working,
    Am                  G
His body's too young to look like his.
   F                 C             Am                         G
My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,
         F                      C
I said, "Somebody's got to take care of him."
   Am                       G
So I quit school and that's what I did.

[Verse 4]
F              C
You got a fast car.
          Am                    G
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
F                 C
We gotta make a decision
Am                        G
Leave tonight or live and die this way.

[Chorus]
                           F
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
C
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
Am
City lights lay out before us
         G
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
    F C       G
and I-I had a feeling that I belonged
    F C       G
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone,
F           G
be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
F              C
You got a fast car.
    Am                     G
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
F                     C
you still ain't got a job
      Am                    G
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
F                      C
I know things will get better
Am                   G
You'll find work and I'll get promoted,
F                     C
We'll move out of the shelter
Am                     G
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
F              C
You got a fast car.
    Am               G
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
F                     C
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
        Am                         G
You see more your friends than you do your kids.
F                    C
I'd always hoped for better,
Am                     G
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
F                      C
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,
   Am                     G
so take your fast car and keep on driving.

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
F              C
You got a fast car.
          Am                     G
But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
F                  C
You gotta make a decision
Am                        G
Leave tonight or live and die this way.
