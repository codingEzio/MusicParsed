             Bb                               Bbsus4
When all the lights out (Hey), where you going?
         Bb                               Bbsus4
I keep a window, for you, it's always open  
           Bb                            Bbsus4
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you going
            Bb
I'm in your head now, from every second now
        Bbsus4
Is your love growing?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Eb           Bb
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
F                   Gm                 Eb
 I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
         Bb               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
      Eb                Bb
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
F                   Gm                              Eb
 I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
         Bb               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
   Eb             Bb
(I want you in my room)
       F           Gm
On the bed, on the floor
   Eb             Bb
(I want you in my room)
F               Gm
I don't care anymore
        Eb               Bb
I wanna do bad things to you
F                   Gm
Slide on through my window
   Eb             Bb
(I want you in my room)
F                        Gm
Baby, don't you want me, too?

[Verse 2]
            Bb                                 Bbsus4
When no one loves you like they really mean it
          Bb
I got you covered, under covers
Bbsus4
 Can you feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
         Eb           Bb
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
F                   Gm                 Eb
 I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
         Bb               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
      Eb                Bb
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
F                   Gm                              Eb
 I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
         Bb               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
   Eb             Bb
(I want you in my room)
       F           Gm
On the bed, on the floor
   Eb             Bb
(I want you in my room)
F               Gm
I don't care anymore
        Eb               Bb
I wanna do bad things to you
F                   Gm
Slide on through my window
   Eb             Bb

Baby, don't you want me, too?
