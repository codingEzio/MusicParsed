[Intro]
E♭
  
[Verse 1]
             B♭                               E♭
When all the lights out (Hey), where you going?
         B♭                               E♭
I keep a window, for you, it's always open  
           Gm                                       E♭
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you going
            Gm
I'm in your head now, from every second now
        E♭
Is your love growing?

[Pre-Chorus]
           B♭           E♭
  Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
F                 Gm                 E♭
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
               B♭         F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
      E♭                B♭
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
F                   Gm                              E♭
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
         B♭               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
   E♭              B♭
(I want you in my room)
       F           Gm
On the bed, on the floor
   E♭             B♭
(I want you in my room)
F              Gm
I don't care anymore
        E♭               B♭
I wanna do bad things to you
F                   Gm
Slide on through my window
   E♭              B♭
(I want you in my room)
F                        Gm
Baby, don't you want me, too?
[Verse 2]
F              B♭                   E♭
   When no one loves you like they really mean it
          B♭
I got you covered, under covers
E♭
Can you feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
            E♭          B♭                     F
  Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder   
                   Gm                 E♭
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
         B♭               F           Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
      E♭                 B♭             F
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over 
                   Gm                              E♭
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
         B♭               F          Gm
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
   E♭              B♭
(I want you in my room)
       F           Gm
On the bed, on the floor
   E♭             B♭
(I want you in my room)
         F      Gm
I don't care anymore
        E♭               B♭
I wanna do bad things to you
F                   Gm
Slide on through my window
   E♭             B♭
(I want you in my room)
F                        Gm
Baby, don't you want me, too?
