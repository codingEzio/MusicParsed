[Verse 1]
             D     Bm D
This was a triumph
    Bm           D
I'm making a note here
Bm           D Bm
HUGE SUCCESS
     Em              A7        D      Bm D
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Bm         D     Bm D
Aperture Science
   Bm             D       Bm      D Bm
we do what we must because we can
Em              A7                   Bb
for the good of all of us except the ones who are dead

[Chorus]
            F        C           Bb       F
But there's no sense crying over every mistake
         F       C                Bb         F
you just keep on trying until you run out of cake
        Gm           C            F      C/E  Dm
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun
        Bb           A7
for the people who are still alive

[Verse 2]
             D    Bm  D
I'm not even angry
Bm          D      Bm      D   Bm
I'm being so sincere right now
Em              A7                       D   Bm D
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
    Bm           D   Bm D
And tore me to pieces
    Bm               D   Bm      D  Bm
And threw every piece into a fire
Em                 A7                    Bb
As they burned, it hurt because I was so happy for you

[Chorus]
          F         C           Bb        F
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
          F      C             Bb         F
And we're out of beta; we're releasing on time
       Bb         C                F       C/E       Dm
So I'm GLaD I got burned; think of all the things we learned
        Bb           A7
for the people who are still alive

[Verse 3]
               D  Bm  D
Go on and leave me
  Bm            D      Bm      D   Bm
I think I prefer to stay inside
Em                A7                  D   Bm D
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Bm           D   Bm D
Maybe Black Mesa?
Bm              D     Bm            D  Bm
That was a joke - haha - FAT CHANCE!
Em           A7                         Bb
Anyway, this cake* is great - it's so delicious and moist

[Chorus]
        F         C                    Bb         F
Look at me, still talking when there's science to do
      F        C                  Bb           F
And I look out there; it makes me GLaD I'm not you
       Bb         C                F       C/E       Dm
I've experiments to run; there is research to be done
       Bb          A7            D
on the people who are still alive

[Outro]
Bm      D           Bm           D
And believe me, I am still alive!
Bm        D             Bm            D
I'm doing science and I'm still alive!
Bm        D             Bm           D
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive!
Bm              D           Bm            D
And when you're dying I'll be still alive!
Bm              D            Bm           D
And when you're dead I will be still alive
Bm         D
Still alive
Bm         D
Still alive
