[Verse 1]
G
Right from the start
           C                  Em
You were a thief you stole my heart
    C              G
And I your willing victim
  G                                C                Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C               G
And with every touch you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus]
    Em             D    A/C#    D      Dsus4
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Em           D   A/C#   D   Dsus4
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Em           D      A/C# D
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     G/B Dsus4  D
Of our love, our love

[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again


[Verse 2]
    G                               C              Em
I'm sorry, I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                     G
I thought that we were fine
 
(Oh, we had everything)
     G                              C                  Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    C                 G
And it's all in your mind
 
(Yeah, but this is happening)

[Pre-Chorus]
Em            D    A/C#     D       Dsus4
You've been having real bad dreams, oh oh
    Em          D  A/C#     D   Dsus4
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
        Em           D    A/C#  D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     G/B Am           C     G/B Dsus4  D
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love

[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4           Em
And we can learn to love again


[Bridge]
                   D/F#
Oh tears ducts and rust
                C
I'll fix it for us
                 D                     Em
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
                  Bm                   C
You're holding it in, you're pouring a drink
                  Am7    Dsus4 D
No, nothing is as bad as it    seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again


[Outro]
     D/F#                        Em
Ohh-ohh, we can learn to love again
     Bm         D              G
Ohh-ohh, we can learn to love again
D/F#    Em
      Ohh
                            Bm
That we're not broken just bent
           D              G
And we can learn to love again
