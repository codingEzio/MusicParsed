                                B♭  C   Dm
Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
                           B♭  C   F
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
  B♭         C                      Dm
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
B♭            C                        Dm
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse

'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

[Chorus]
I get a little lonely
                  B♭        C
Get a little more close to me
F                       B♭        C
You're the only one who knows me, babe   
Dm                       B♭              C
So hot you're hurting my feelings (Woo)   
        F
Can't deal  

[Verse 2]
                               B♭  C   Dm
With all the X-rated dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
                                 B♭  C   F
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
                                B♭  C   Dm
You know I live for the hustle (Ah, ah, ah)
