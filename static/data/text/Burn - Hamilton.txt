Verse:
  Bm                      F#
I saved ev'ry letter you wrote me
G                  D
 From the moment I read them
  Em7           Bm
I knew you were mine
                  F#
You said you were mine
                   G     D  D/C#
I thought you were mine
 
Bm                  F#
 Do you know what Angelica said
        Gmaj7                   Dsus4
When we saw your first letter arrive?
 
She said
Bm                F#
 “Be careful with that one, love
        Gmaj7                  Dsus4      
He will do what it takes to survive.”
 
Pre-Chorus:
             Bm               F#
You and your words flooded my senses
     Gmaj7               D
Your sentences left me defenseless
Em7          Bm             F#
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
            Gmaj7     D  F#m
You built cathedrals
         Bm                    F#
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
    Gmaj7                      D
I’m searching and scanning for answers
    Em7  Bm
In every line
                  F#
For some kind of sign
    F#aug         D/G Gmaj7
And when you were mine
    G
The world seemed to
 
Chorus:
D    Bm  F#m  G
Burn
D    Bm  F#m  G
Burn
 
Verse:
     Bm                        F#
You published the letters she wrote you
    Gmaj7                        Dsus4
You told the whole world how you brought
                   Bm
This girl into our bed
                 F#                        Gmaj7    Dsus4
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
 

Bm                 F#           Gmaj7
Do you know what Angelica said
                          Dsus4
When she read what you’d done?
         Bm
She said
                      F#m  F#
“You have married an Icarus
        G                     D     A
He has flown too close to the sun.”
 
Pre-Chorus:
             Bm                        F#7
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
     Gsus2     G         D
Your sentences border on senseless
A           Bm                F#7
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
            Gsus2/
How they perceive you
 
You, you, you…
 
     Bm                      F#
I’m erasing myself from the narrative
    Gsus2             D           Em7
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
  Bm                       F#
Reacted when you broke her heart
Gsus2     G            D/G
 You have torn it all apart
     G
I am watching it
 
Chorus:
D    Bm F#m
Burn
G            D    Bm  F#m
 Watching it burn
 
Bridge:
    G                        D
The world has no right to my heart
                  Daug    
The world has no place in our bed
     Bm                       D/G   
They don’t get to know what I said
    A7sus4      D
I’m burning the memories
            Daug                     Bm
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
    D/G          A7sus4      D
You forfeit all rights to my heart
                Gm/Bb  
You forfeit the place in our bed
       Bm                     G
You'll sleep in your office instead
     A7sus4   Dsus2
With only the memories
                 D    D Gsus2/
Of when you were mine
 
Outro:
                Bm  F# Gmaj7 Dsus4 B7sus2
I hope that you burn
