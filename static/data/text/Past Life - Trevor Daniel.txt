[Intro x2]
Em Bm D A

[Verse 1]
    Em                          Bm
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
                   D          A
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
    Em                           Bm
And I don't want to sit all in my sadness
             D         A
I know it's a habit of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Em               Bm
Perfect, perfect timing
D                              A
I start but I don't know  how to end
Em                 Bm
Don't re-, don't remind me
D                       A
I ruined it before it began, ooh

[Chorus]
Em                 G                     D
Last night was the last night of my past life
                 A
Got me here like you can never figure me out
Em                 G                      D
Last night was the last time, was the last time
           A
I'll never let you figure me out
Em                       G
Sitting here, talking to myself
               D
Thinking how I used to use you
A
Only thing I'm used to
Em                 G                    D     A
Last night was the last night of my past life, woah

[Verse 2]
Em                           Bm
Gave me what I wanted when I needed it
            D      A
Honestly, I mean it
Em                                Bm
And if I could convince myself to feel it
                 D          A
You know I would feel it, I would

[Pre-Chorus]
Em               Bm
Perfect, perfect timing
D                              A
I start but I don't know  how to end
Em                 Bm
Don't re-, don't remind me
D                       A
I ruined it before it began, ooh

Got me here like you can never figure me out
Em                 G                      D
Last night was the last time, was the last time
           A
I'll never let you figure me out
Em                       G
Sitting here, talking to myself

Will never go away

Will never go away
