[Verse 1]
C         Am                       Em
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
C                   Am                         Em
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
C                           Am
He's on the British side in Georgia
Em
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
C                       Am
Well he can keep all of Georgia
'Cause Theodosia, she's mine

[Chorus]
Am                        F
Love doesn't discriminate
                            G
Between the sinners and the saints
                G
It takes and it takes and it takes 
    Am                    F
And we keep lovin' anyway
                G
We laugh and we fall and we break
       G
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  F
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
     G
When so many have tried
               Am          F
I'm willing to wait for it
                     Gsus4
Then, I'm willing to wait for it

[Verse 2]
C                    Am                 Em
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, 
preacher, preacher, preacher
C                             Am                       Em
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, 
teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
C               Am       
My mother was a genius
     Em
My father commanded respect, respect
C                   Am
When they died they left no instructions, 
just a legacy to protect

[Chorus]
Am                         F
Death doesn’t discriminate
                            G
Between the sinners and the saints
                G
It takes and it takes and it takes 
      Am                    F
Yeah, we keep living anyway
               G
We rise and we fall and we break
       G
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  F
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
     G
When everyone who loves me has died
                     Am          F
Then, I’m willing to wait for it
Then I’m willing to wait for it

[Bridge]
Am 
Wait for it, wait for it
Am
Wait for it, wait for it     
C                     G             Am
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Am
Wait for it, wait for it)
F
I am inimitable, I am an original
Am 
(Wait for it, wait for it
Am
Wait for it, wait for it)
C                  G
I am not falling behind or running late
Am 
(Wait for it, wait for it
Am
Wait for it, wait for it)
F
I am not standing still, 

[Bridge 2]
              Am
I am lying in wait
       Am
(Wait, wait, wait)
C                 G              Am
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
        Am
(Climb, climb, climb)
F                          
He got something to prove, 
                  Am
he got nothing to lose
       Am
(Lose, lose, lose, lose)
C                    G
Hamilton's pace is relentless, 
             Am
he wastes no time
       Am
(Time, time, time)
G
What is it like in his shoes?

[Chorus]
Am                        F
Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
                 G
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
    Am                      F
And he keeps winning anyway
               G
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
    Am                  F
And if there’s a reason
                           G
He seems to thrive when so few survive, 
                               Am          F
Then Goddamnit— I'm willing to wait for it
               G
I'm willing to wait for it...

[Chorus]
Am 
Life doesn't discriminate
F                           G
Between the sinners and the saints
                G
It takes and it takes and it takes
    Am                    F 
And we keep living anyway
               G
We rise and we fall and we break
       G
And we make our mistakes
    Am                  F
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
     G
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—
