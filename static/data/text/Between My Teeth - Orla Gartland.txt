[Verse 1]
C
  You say my name
 
  I pull away
Am
  I can't help it, I can't take on all your pain
C
  There's a guilt in this
 
  I taste in every kiss
Am
  I don't know, I'm just a little selfish
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Dm             C
You need me, I don't need you
     Am
Just admit it, admit it
   Dm                C
Oh I'm too broken to fix you too
  Am
I admit it, I admit it
 
 
[Chorus]
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F      Am
  I, I think I better leave
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F                Am
I can't take the pressure of it
C            Dm
I can barely breathe
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth, no
 
 
[Verse 2]
C
  In a perfect world
 
  I'm the perfect girl
Am
  So together always there to solve your problems
C
  But underneath
 
  It's bittersweet
Am
  The more I give the more I'm feeling incomplete
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Dm             C
You need me, I don't need you
     Am
Just admit it, admit it
   Dm                C
Oh I'm too broken to fix you too
  Am
I admit it, I admit it
 
 
[Chorus]
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F      Am
  I, I think I better leave
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F                Am
I can't take the pressure of it
C            Dm
I can barely breathe
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth, no
 
 
[Bridge]
Dm            C
I-I-I bite my tongue
       Am                  G
'Cause I don't know how to tell you
    Dm                   C    Am G
I'm getting this urge to run
    Dm            C
And I-I-I bite my tongue
       Am                  G
'Cause I don't know how to tell you
     Dm                   C
That you deserve someone else
        Am               G
Who can treat you like I want to
 
 
[Chorus]
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F      Am
  I, I think I better leave
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth
F                Am
I can't take the pressure of it
C            Dm
I can barely breathe
F        Am
  Ah ah, please don't lean on me
       C                 Dm
'Cause I don't want your heart between my teeth, no
